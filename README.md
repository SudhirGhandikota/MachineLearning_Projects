# MachineLearning_Projects
This repository consists of various Machine Leraning related projects as part of my course curriculum at University of Cincinnati.
Each one of them has its own data sets and are solve different problems. 
Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implemented.

## Badges_Game.py
This project implements a supervised machine learning algorithm(Decision Tree) to solve a classic ML problem called the "Badges Problem".
"Information Gain" measure is used in designing the decision tree model
An external too called "dot tool" is used to print the decision tree designed in the project.

## Binning.py
This is a basic statistical analysis project where the data rows are binned using both equal frequency and equal width partitioning techniques.
Then to further achieve accurate results z-score normalization is implemented and then the binning is performed again with the normalized values and the difference have been documented.
Also based on the z-core values, labels have been assigned for two of the attributes and attribute most suited to predict the predictor variable is identified by calculating the "Information Gain" individually for either of them.
